      "Estimated integral error ( 1.3615578318037562e-05 ) larger than tolerance ( 3e-06 ), which is maybe not enough (but maybe it's also fine). You can (best solution) implement an anatytical integral (see examples in repo) or manually set a higher number on the PDF with 'update_integration_options' and increase the 'max_draws' (or adjust 'tol'). If partial integration is chosen, this can lead to large memory consumption.This is a new warning checking the integral accuracy. It may warns too often as it is Work In Progress. If you have any observation on it, please tell us about it: https://github.com/zfit/zfit/issues/new/chooseTo suppress this warning, use zfit.settings.set_verbosity(-1).\n"
