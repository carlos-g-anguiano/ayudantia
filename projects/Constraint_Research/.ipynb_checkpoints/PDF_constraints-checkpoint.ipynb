You can (best solution) implement an anatytical integral (see examples in repo) or manually set a higher number on the PDF with 'update_integration_options' and increase the 'max_draws' (or adjust 'tol'). If partial integration is chosen, this can lead to large memory consumption.This is a new warning checking the integral accuracy. It may warns too often as it is Work In Progress.
